PerlIO::gzip version 0.06
=========================

A layer for the PerlIO system to transparently gzip/gunzip files.
Alpha at the moment, only gunzips.

YOU NEED PERL 5.7.0 or later
                            yes. this only works on UNSTABLE DEVELOPMENT PERL

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   echo I know that this is alpha quality and I am using it at my own risk
   make install

That echo statement is particularly important.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires perl 5.7 or later compiler with PerlIO.
(which is not the default yet)

BUGS

Threads - I doubt this module is threadsafe.
flush() doesn't really flush, just empty the buffer

TODO

Lots:

Rewrite flush to really flush, and write a PerlIOGzip_write() rather than
rely on PerlIOBuf_write, which calls flush() to empty the buffer each time.
Test more
Cope with crlf systems. Should this layer turn off crlf on the layer below
and turn it on on itself?
Cope with utf8. Should the utf8 flag be hiked above us?
Test more
Worry about threads.
Writing headers with fancy stuff (filename, comment, extra info, header crc)
What to about the "TEXT" flag in the gzip header
Test more
Detect OS type at build time
