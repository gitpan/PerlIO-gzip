      Change name from Layer::Gzip to PerlIO::gzip following feedback on p5p.
      Add checks to Makefile.PL to ensure you have 5.7.0 [or later :-)] and
      PerlIO configure.

      Added autopop mode.  There must be a better name for it.
      Changed order in PerlIOGzip_pushed to call PerlIObuf first (D'oh)
      and to pop without error in autopop mode with a write.

      Mmm. CRCs at the ends of files - maybe I should check them?
      Now gives error on close if the z_stream is at the end and either
      the CRC or the length recorded in the gzip trailer is wrong.  Doesn't
      try these checks for files with no gzip header.
      PROTOTYPES: DISABLE in the .xs

      We have compression!
      Hmm. Didn't check the return from close on perl.gz - transpires there
      was a bug in my code to read the length of uncompressed data from the
      gzip file
      Hmm. Why was I passing *my* args down to the PerlIOBuf I'm a derived
      class of? On the other hand, why not? ISA or HASA? My args, HASA, I
      guess, so I'll give it NULL args.

      s/to/too/ in the BARF message in Makefile.PL [1 character change. Look
      at the paperwork that generated :-)]
      use XSLoader rather than Dynaloader.

      fix bug in get_more's return value that basically prevented you from
      reading any header with embedded filename from an unbuffered layer.
      [Obscure, but it's suppoed to work with unbuffered] However, still
      problems with unread, so you can't inflate any gzip file with an
      original filename (or comment) in the header. This is related to the
      /* fix me */ mentioned in perlio.c. Hopefully it will be soon.

      The perlio.c layer API has changed by the 5.7.1 release. 0.08 and earlier
      won't compile - 0.09 mainly consists of necessary changes to function
      prototypes and the layer struct. 5.7.1 contains a known bug - when
      opening a file with layers specified, failure of a layer to push is
      supposed to cause the open to fail. In 5.7.0 it did. In 5.7.1 it doesn't.
      Commented the tests that will fail due to this bug.
      Attempted to detect the "OS" type at compile time to set the default
      OS for the gzip header.

      By 5.7.2 it seems that the pushed argument is passed in as &sv_undef
      rather than NULL. I wasn't testing SvOK() and was getting use of
      uninitialized value errors.

0.11  Mon Oct 29 20:28:38 GMT 2001
      perlio.c layer API has changed again with the addition of a dup()
      function for cloning layers across. (both within and across ithreads)
      Currently I don't want to pretend that PerlIO::gzip can cope with this,
      hence it will croak. Fixing this properly is a TODO.
