      Change name from Layer::Gzip to PerlIO::gzip following feedback on p5p.
      Add checks to Makefile.PL to ensure you have 5.7.0 [or later :-)] and
      PerlIO configure.

      Added autopop mode.  There must be a better name for it.
      Changed order in PerlIOGzip_pushed to call PerlIObuf first (D'oh)
      and to pop without error in autopop mode with a write.

      Mmm. CRCs at the ends of files - maybe I should check them?
      Now gives error on close if the z_stream is at the end and either
      the CRC or the length recorded in the gzip trailer is wrong.  Doesn't
      try these checks for files with no gzip header.
      PROTOTYPES: DISABLE in the .xs

      We have compression!
      Hmm. Didn't check the return from close on perl.gz - transpires there
      was a bug in my code to read the length of uncompressed data from the
      gzip file
      Hmm. Why was I passing *my* args down to the PerlIOBuf I'm a derived
      class of? On the other hand, why not? ISA or HASA? My args, HASA, I
      guess, so I'll give it NULL args.

      s/to/too/ in the BARF message in Makefile.PL [1 character change. Look
      at the paperwork that generated :-)]
      use XSLoader rather than Dynaloader.
